The TES68 keyboard does not officially support ISO layout, but by replacing few of the hotswap sockets and using a custom plate you can unlock full ISO compatibility.
# DISCLAIMER
## There is always a chance the pcb design will be changed to a version that does not support ISO.

# STABILISERS MIGHT NOT WORK PROPERLY WITH A 3D PRINTED PLATE
